6502 Backend Initial Prototype
==============================
This directory contains an implementation of a basic proof-of-concept prototype
for the compiler.  It doesn't have particularly sophisticated code generation,
and there are more unhandled C-language constructs than handled. It mostly
served to demonstrate that building such a backend is not obviously infeasible.
