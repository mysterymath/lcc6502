# End-to-End Tests

This folder contains end-to-end acceptance tests for the compiler. These
tests help ensure basic compiler functionality remains working as changes are
made. They also help to provide examples of how to use the compiler in a
variety of scenarios.

Upon success, all tests end with $A in the A register, but with very different
mechanisms.
